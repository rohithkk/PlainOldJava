These are the steps to add your existing code to GitHub assuming that 
I already have EGit installed on Eclipse.
------------------------XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX------------------------

1). Create new project in Eclipse workspace.

2). Right click on the project, select Team -> Share -> Git

3). If you already have a local repository, select it from the list. Otherwise, click Create button 
	to create a new local repository.
	
4). Click finish to add the project to Git. At this time, you project may be moved from your original Eclipse workspace 
	to the Git local repository path you've mentioned in the above step. If you have any files from your project opened 
	and if you try to edit those file, you will get a prompt saying that the orignal file no longer exists. 
	
5). Now, right click on the project, Team-> Commit. Enter a commit message, select all the files that need to be committed to the repo and click finish.

6). At this time, you can see master being created under the Local Branch. (Open Git Repositories view or swtich to Git Perspective to see this).

7). Log on to GitHub.com and create a new repository. Copy the URL of the repo.

8). Right click on the "Remotes" in Git Repositories window and select Create Remote. Keep the name origin for the remote and select "Configure Push".
